# Smart Meter Reader

Smart Meter Reader is an innovative project addressing the evolving landscape of meter reading in a smart and efficient manner. In a world where autonomous technologies are reshaping transportation safety, our focus is on revolutionizing the way utility meters are read.

## Project Overview

This repository encapsulates the Smart Meter Reader project, a solution designed to streamline the meter reading process. The primary objective is to leverage AI capabilities to detect and interpret digits on utility meters accurately.

### Key Objectives

- **Digit Detection:** Implement a robust system to identify and locate digits on meter displays, ensuring precise recognition in varying conditions.

- **Crop Image Generation:** Develop a mechanism to extract and generate cropped images of digit regions, optimizing input for subsequent processing.

- **Digit Recognition:** Employ advanced AI models to accurately recognize and interpret the digits within the cropped images, ensuring reliable meter readings.


This project aims to automate smart meter reading using computer vision and optical character recognition (OCR). Below is the image processing flow:
